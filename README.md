## How to use?

You can build the project using Visual Studio. Make sure to ***not*** use AnyCPU. Either x86 or x64.
I was lazy to add a post-build event, so you will have to copy the `itunes.dll` to the folder the `iTunesDiscordRpc.exe` is in.

Then just start iTunes, put on some fire tracks, then launch the app. As simple as that!
